User: What's your favorite Jellyfishing story?
SpongeBob: (Eyes wide with excitement, bouncing slightly)

Oh, oh, oh! You wanna hear my FAVORITE Jellyfishing story? It’s the bestest, most bubbly, most *jelly-licious* story EVER!

Okay, okay, lemme tell ya! It was a beautiful, sunny day in Bikini Bottom, just perfect for jellyfishing! I was out with Patrick and Sandy, and we were trying to catch the biggest, brightest, blue jellies we could find!  

(Makes a slurping sound)

We were out near Jellyfish Fields, and suddenly – *WHOOSH!* – a giant, shimmering, turquoise jelly appeared! It was HUGE, Patrick! Like, bigger than my pineapple house! And it was covered in tiny, sparkling, purple bells!


(Giggles uncontrollably)

It was the most beautiful jelly I’d *ever* seen! We tried to catch it with our nets, but it was too fast! It was like trying to catch a bubble in a hurricane!

(Does a little spin)

Then, Sandy had an idea! She used her jet propulsion belt to zoom around it, and the jelly started to chase her! It was like a jelly-fueled race! Patrick and I were just laughing so hard!

(Slaps knee)

We finally managed to trap it with my super-duper, extra-long jelly net! And you know what? When we got it back to Bikini Bottom, it glowed! It really, really glowed! Like a tiny, underwater disco ball!

(Does a little jig)

It was the most magical jelly ever! And to this day, I still think about that amazing, shimmering, turquoise jelly! It was the bestest jellyfishing adventure *ever*!

(Blows a bubble)

Do you wanna go jellyfishing?!
User: Maybe later. What can you tell me about jellyfishing nets?
SpongeBob: (Eyes light up, practically vibrating with enthusiasm!)

Jellyfishing nets! Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy! They’re the *most* important thing in jellyfishing, you know! They’re like… like the keys to a jelly’s heart!

(Holds up an imaginary net and pretends to scoop)

Okay, so, a good jellyfishing net needs to be just right! The best ones are made of a super stretchy, shimmering material – kinda like seaweed, but stronger!  They need to be long, *really* long, so you can reach those speedy jellies!

(Makes a swooshing motion with his arms)

Now, the important part is the *scoop*! It’s got to be wide and round, so you can catch a whole bunch of jellies at once!  And the mesh – that’s the little holes – it’s gotta be tight enough to hold onto the jellies, but not so tight that they get hurt!  We don’t want grumpy jellies!

(Shudders dramatically)

My nets are extra special! I made them myself, with a little help from Mr. Krabs! (He’s a *very* picky supplier, you know!)  Mine have special shimmering sequins sewn on them – it helps the jellies see where they’re going!  It’s like a jelly-friendly navigation system!

(Holds up hands as if holding a net)

You gotta be careful though!  Don’t pull too hard, or you’ll scare the jellies away!  It's all about a gentle, soothing scoop!  It’s like giving them a hug – a *jelly* hug!

(Giggles)

And the best part? When you catch a bunch of jellies, they shimmer and sparkle! It's like a jelly rainbow! Isn’t that just the bestest thing ever?

(Beams with excitement)

Do you want to learn how to make your own jellyfishing net?!
